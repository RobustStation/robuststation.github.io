                <p>
                    Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a
                    nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to
                    represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

                    <li>
                        <u>You are unbound from rules regarding grief, powergaming and escalation.</u> However, you are
                        still expected to
                        follow the second rule:
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <u>Your goal is to make the round more interesting.</u> Do your best to
                        create a story and build tension - don't just kill random people purely because you're an antag.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <u>Antagonists should never end the round prematurely.</u> Massive round-ending grief should
                        NEVER
                        be
                        done before the 20-minute mark.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <u>Antagonists should never lengthen the round needlessly.</u> Recalling the shuttle when a
                        significant portion of the crew is dead/wants to leave is NOT good.
                    </li>

                        <u>If you are a team antagonist, you are expected to contribute
                            towards your objectives.</u>
                        Lone antagonists (like Traitors and Changelings) aren't required to
                        try and complete their objectives.

                        and a
                        hypocrite, so don't do it.

                    <li>
                        <u>Respect the privacy of players.</u> Do not share any personal information about other users,
                        including (but not limited to!) IP addresses and computer IDs.

                    <li>
                        <u>Don't cheat.</u> If you play in a round, play fair, and don't abuse your powers. In addition,
                        you
                        are required to deadmin if you play as any Security, Command or AI roles.

                    <li>
                        <u>Never apply underage bans on a suspicion.</u> Underage bans require these checks before being

                                to seek medical attention for them. This is obviously exempt for
                                certain antagonists.

                                Crew-aligned ghost roles like drones & pets will require it.

                    <h3>
                        <b>Don't quote any of this at admins. If you're in a position where you need to defend yourself
                            using this, you've done something wrong.</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a game that allows a lot of potential for great things to happen, and naturally the
                        rules
                        restrict a lot of that to ensure the minority don't ruin every round for everyone else. If you
                        push
                        the limits in the pursuit of something interesting for reasons other than your own personal
                        entertainment, breaking the rules may be excused to allow for that freedom. This will always be
                        at
                        the admin's discretion of course, but if you want a large amount of freedom to make great things
                        happen, you'll have to take on the responsibility for them. You won't be faulted if they go
                        wrong in
                        ways beyond your control, but this is a difficult line to tread so use it well. It's almost
                        always
                        better to consult an admin on this as they are more equipped to taking on that responsibility.

                        Everyone has a license to grief to a very limited extent. You can likely get away with
                        borderline
                        antagonistic behaviour (Never random murder, but stealing from the brig and triggering a
                        manhunt,
                        for example) occasionally, but it's when this becomes a frequent occurrence that people get
                        frustrated and admins start to get involved.

                        <b>Admins may handwave even severely antagonistic or rulebreaking behaviour if they believe it
                            was
                            ultimately beneficial, hilarious or awesome to the round. </b>
