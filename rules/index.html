                These rules are not fully copied over and have some discrepancies
                between current rules. I'm working on cleaning up the rules so they
                aren't a PITA to read. Use the ones on the Discord for now.

                            relationships with other characters, as long as it's not to team

                        okay. Obviously, names should also follow the rules.

                            Don't escalate situations needlessly. Not everything requires a

                            If your opponent ends up in critical condition, you should try
                            to seek medical attention for them. This is obviously exempt for
                            certain antagonists.

                            Antagonistic and pest ghost roles do not require escalation.
                            Crew-aligned ghost roles like drones & pets will require it.

                            Antagonists are not expected to escalate. Read the Antagonist Guidelines below for more

                    <u>You are unbound from rules regarding grief, powergaming and escalation.</u> However, you are
                    still expected to
                    follow the second rule:
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Your goal is to make the round more interesting.</u> Do your best to
                    create a story and build tension - don't just kill random people purely because you're an antag.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Antagonists should never end the round prematurely.</u> Massive round-ending grief should NEVER
                    be
                    done before the 20-minute mark.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Antagonists should never lengthen the round needlessly.</u> Recalling the shuttle when a
                    significant portion of the crew is dead/wants to leave is NOT good.
                </li>

                    <u>If you are a team antagonist, you are expected to contribute
                        towards your objectives.</u>
                    Lone antagonists (like Traitors and Changelings) aren't required to
                    try and complete their objectives.

                    hypocrite, so don't do it.

                <li>

                <li>
                    <u>Never apply underage bans on a suspicion.</u> Underage bans require these checks before being applied:
                    
                    <ul class="precedents">
                        <li>Is the information from a reputable source? The <u>ONLY</u> reputable sources are a) messages sent in an official RobustStation place, b) similar bans from another, reputable community, c) them admitting themselves.</li>
                        <li>Is the information ethically sourced? Admins should NEVER actively search for a player's age outside of asking them. Like fucking hell guys dont hunt down peoples age so you can ban the 14 year old. Additionally, information given by a third party is usually not ethically sourced.</li>
                        <li>Has the information been reviewed and approved by at least three admins?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Once ALL of these checks are done, you may permaban the member with the reason "Underage ban, age: [PUT AGE HERE]".
