                <p>
                    These rules are not fully copied over and have some discrepancies between current rules. I'm working on cleaning up the rules so they aren't a PITA to read. Use the ones on the Discord for now.

                <h2>Server Rules</h2>

                <ol start="0">
                    <li>
                        <u>Admins always have the final say.</u> If an admin tells you to stop doing something, stop it. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>No sexual content!</u> This is very much a non-negotiable and WILL get you banned.

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You can still call people dicks/pussies, and make crude Ligma-style jokes. No further than that.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Don't be a jerk.</u> Bigotry is a hard NO and will very quickly get you disappeared. Otherwise, treat each other with respect. If you're not an antagonist, you are expected not to grief. In addition:

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Space Racism is still racism. You aren't funny. Just don't.</li>
                                <li>Metagrudging (getting back at someone who wronged you in an earlier round) is a dick move and will get you bwoinked.</li>
                                <li>Repeatedly breaking into places to steal resources you don't normally have access to will lead to a ban.</li>
                                <li>If someone breaks into your department and refuses to leave when asked, feel free to robust them.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>No metagaming.</u> Metagaming is where someone uses OOC means to gain information about a current round. This is mainly targeted at using outside communication to get that information (metacomms).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Security & Command are held to a higher standard.</u> Breaking rules as a member of either department will lead to harder and longer punishments. In addition, you must follow Space Law.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Security & Command must follow Space Law.</u> Members of either department are held to a higher standard in regards to the rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Escalation is required.</u> Members of either department are held to a higher standard in regards to the rules.

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don't escalate situations needlessly. Not everything requires a fight to the death.</li>
                                <li>If your opponent ends up in critical condition, you should try to seek medical attention for them. This is obviously exempt for certain antagonists.</li>
                                <li>Antagonistic and pest ghost roles do not require escalation. Crew-aligned ghost roles like drones & pets will require it.</li>
                                <li>Antagonists are still expected to escalate when reasonable</li>
                            </ul>
