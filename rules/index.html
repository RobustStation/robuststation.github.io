                These rules are not fully copied over and have some discrepancies
                between current rules. I'm working on cleaning up the rules so they
                aren't a PITA to read. Use the ones on the Discord for now.

                    <h3>
                        <b>Don't quote any of this at admins. If you're in a position where you need to defend yourself using this, you've done something wrong.</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a game that allows a lot of potential for great things to happen, and naturally the rules restrict a lot of that to ensure the minority don't ruin every round for everyone else. If you push the limits in the pursuit of something interesting for reasons other than your own personal entertainment, breaking the rules may be excused to allow for that freedom. This will always be at the admin's discretion of course, but if you want a large amount of freedom to make great things happen, you'll have to take on the responsibility for them. You won't be faulted if they go wrong in ways beyond your control, but this is a difficult line to tread so use it well. It's almost always better to consult an admin on this as they are more equipped to taking on that responsibility. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone has a license to grief to a very limited extent. You can likely get away with borderline antagonistic behaviour (Never random murder, but stealing from the brig and triggering a manhunt, for example) occasionally, but it's when this becomes a frequent occurrence that people get frustrated and admins start to get involved. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Admins may handwave even severely antagonistic or rulebreaking behaviour if they believe it was ultimately beneficial, hilarious or awesome to the round. </b>

                    follow the second rule:
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Your goal is to make the round more interesting.</u> Do your best to
                    create a story and build tension - don't just kill random people purely because you're an antag.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Antagonists should never end the round prematurely.</u> Massive round-ending grief should NEVER
                    be
                    done before the 20-minute mark.

                <li>
                    <u>Antagonists should never lengthen the round needlessly.</u> Recalling the shuttle when a

                    Lone antagonists (like Traitors and Changelings) aren't required to

                        <li>Is the information ethically sourced? Admins should NEVER actively search for a player's age outside of asking them. dditionally, information given by a third party is usually not ethically sourced.</li>
